# Deep-Learning-on-the-Edge
DL-on-the-Edge is a repository for keeping all the object detection demos for my talk at Google Developers Group (GDG) Mumbai and Bangalore 2019.
Accessible and affordable compute power, volume and variety of data, better algorithms and frameworks are the 3 major reasons why Deep Learning as a field has exploded and has become so popular in the last decade. This talk was primarily focused on the first aspect - compute power and how modern DL based solutions can be deployed on edge devices with minimal compute power. Solutions like NUC (Next Unit of Computing) and NCS2 (Neural Compute Stick - 2) were discussed and how they can be leveraged to build solutions like auto-navigating robots and assistive devices with accompanying demos.
